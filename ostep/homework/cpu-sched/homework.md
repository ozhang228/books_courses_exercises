# Homework

1. Compute the response time and turnaround time when running three jobs of length 200 with the SJF and FIFO schedulers.

Job 0 ( length = 200)
Job 1 ( length = 200)
Job 2 ( length = 200)

# FIFO 

- Turnaround Time

(200 + 400 + 600) / 3 == 400

- Response Time

(0 + 200 + 400) / 3 == 200

# SJF

- Turnaround Time

(200 + 400 + 600) / 3 == 400

- Response Time

(0 + 200 + 400) / 3 == 200

2. Now do the same but with jobs of different lengths: 100, 200, and 300.

# FIFO 
  Job 0 ( length = 100)
  Job 1 ( length = 200)
  Job 2 ( length = 300)

- Turnaround Time

(100 + 300 + 600) / 3 == 333.3

- Response Time

(0 + 100 + 300) / 3 == 133.3

# SJF

- Turnaround Time

(100 + 300 + 600) / 3 == 333.3

- Response Time

(0 + 100 + 300) / 3 == 133.3

3. Now do the same, but also with the RR scheduler and a time-slice of 1.

# 200, 200, 200

- Turnaround time
   
(598 + 599 + 600) / 3 == 599

- Response Time

(0 + 1 + 2) / 3 == 1

# 100, 200, 300 

- Turnaround time
   
(298 + 499 + 600) / 3 == (1397 / 3)

- Response Time

(0 + 1 + 2) / 3 == 1

4. For what types of workloads does SJF deliver the same turnaround times as FIFO?

For workloads that come in non-decreasing order.

5. For what types of workloads and quantum lengths does SJF deliver the same response times as RR?
  
When every process is equal in length to the quantum length.

6. What happens to response time with SJF as job lengths increase? Can you use the simulator to demonstrate the trend?

Response time goes up because SJF doesn't prempt.

7. What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths increase? Can you write an equation that gives the worst-case response time, given N jobs?

It goes up.

q = quantum length
N = number of jobs 

response time = (1 / N) \sigma{1}{N}(i - 1)q
